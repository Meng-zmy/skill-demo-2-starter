## Skill Demonstration 2

For the second skill demonstration, you will create a video screencast of
yourself doing some tasks related to editing and debugging **entirely in a remote
terminal**.

You should complete the following tasks, all recorded as part of your screencast:

1. Show your face on a webcam and your picture ID (ideally your student ID).
1. Log into your course-specific account on `ieng6`.
2. Clone this repository: [skill-demo-2-starter](https://github.com/kheravi/skill-demo-2-starter)
3. In that repository, run `make test`, which causes an infinite loop.
4. Open the `makefile` using `vim`. Add a new rule `debug-test` that will run
the tests using `jdb` instead of `java`. (Use the material/videos from Week 8 if
you're not sure how.)
4. Use `make debug-test` to determine which test is causing the infinite loop.
Demonstrate this by suspending the program in `jdb` and showing the stack trace.
Say _out loud in the video_ which test is triggering the infinite loop, and
which methods in `LinkedList` are on the stack.
5. Use `jdb` to show the local variables in the method/loop that was running at
the time the program was suspended.  Use `step` to move forward in the program
until it reaches the same line again.
6. Say **_out loud in the video_** what you think the problem is that's causing the
infinite loop.
5. Exit the debugger, then open the code file `LinkedList.java` with `vim` and
edit it to fix the infinite loop while still passing all the other tests.
6. Re-run `make test` and show all the tests passing successfully.

Your video should be no longer than 10 minutes. You may need to practice it a
few times to get it right and get it to under 10 minutes. It's impossible for us
to enforce that you don't discuss the bug that causes the infinite loop, but
you'll learn more if you try to figure it out on your own.

You're free to use any and all course notes/code/videos/labs/etc. for help,
along with your prior work. Your video must be entirely your own work.
